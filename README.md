### Personal Comment 
This project was created for my cousin’s quinceañera. My goal was to design a webpage that captured the beauty and excitement of the celebration while remaining interactive, responsive, and easy to use. Beyond being a personal gift, it also served as a hands-on opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills — blending event functionality, form validation, and user-centered design into one polished experience.
